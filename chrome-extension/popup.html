	<h1>TALK-TO-ChatGPT</h1>
	
	<p style='font-size: 15px;'>
		<b>To start using this extension, 
		you need to open the <a href='https://chat.openai.com/chat' target=_blank>ChatGPT home page</a></b>.
		
		Once you are logged in, a box will display at the top right corner of your screen with a 'START' button.
		Click START to start talking.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This extension allows you to talk to ChatGPT with your microphone, using your browser's voice recognition API.
		Then, when your browser receives the reply, it is read out loud with a voice of your choosing.
		<br /><br />
		&bullet; When the box's bottom border is <b style='color:red'>red</b>, your microphone is listening<br />
		&bullet; When the box's bottom border is <b style='color:green'>green</b>, the bot is talking<br />
		&bullet; Access the settings by clicking the settings icon: change voice/language, bot talking speed, and more.

	<h1>Having trouble getting it to work?</h1>
	
	<p>
		1. This extension is only designed for Chromium-based desktop browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. 
		If it doesn't work in your specific browser, it's because your browser doesn't support the necessary APIs. 
		There is no need to contact us to add support to another browser, we can't do anything about it. 
		Support for these APIs must be implemented by the browser itself.
		<br /><br />
		
		2. What to do if the computer isn't recognizing text when you speak? 
			Did you make sure to give permission to use your microphone?
			Is the microphone recording volume high enough?
			Check this 
			<a href='https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html' target=_blank>speech recognition test page</a>.
			If the speech recognition isn't working on that page, then it won't work on Talk-to-ChatGPT.
			Also, for Mac users, make sure your laptop's lid isn't in a closed state 
			(because of <a href='https://thehackernews.com/2018/10/apple-macbook-microphone.html' target=_blank>this</a>).
			
		<br /><br />

		3. What to do if the bot's voice is scrambled, jammed, or not working at all?
			Try opening the settings and changing the bot's voice to a different option. Also make sure the talking speed is set to 1.
			Sometimes, voices listed in the text-to-speech API don't work correctly, for some reason.
			
		<br /><br />
		
		4. What if it worked well for a bit, and suddenly nothing works correctly anymore? 
		In that case, try restarting your browser. 
		There is sometimes <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21947730/chrome-speech-synthesis-with-longer-texts'>a bug with Chromium's voice API</a>,
		when the bug occurs, it can completely jam the API until you restart your browser.
